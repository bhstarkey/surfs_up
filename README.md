## Summary

The great news for the investors is that Hawaii has pretty consistent weather with only a 4 degree change is the average temperature from June to December. The minimum was a difference of 8 degrees, and the max temp was a difference of 2 degrees. 

The first additional query I would run is to group the prepitation and weather data by the station location, to help narrow down a more precise location for the new surf/ice cream shop. While Oahu is an island, there may be parts that see more or less rain depending on where it is on the island.

The second additional query I would add to gather more weather data Oahu is to group the temperature and precipitation data by the dates, to see if the coldest days and the rainiest days line up. If they do, that would be another item to consider for the shop, as it could mean a steep drop of revenue on those days.

I would also pull the summary statistics for every month to make sure that the weather is mild the whole year, and there isn't a month that sticks out and has much worse weather.
